I like the same content to be consumable by both people and machines.

The trick is not to over-engineer it:

- **Human view**: calmer typography, narrative pacing, fewer mechanical cues.
- **Agent view**: stable sections, explicit keys, compact spacing.

If the selector between these modes feels intentional, users understand the contract immediately.
