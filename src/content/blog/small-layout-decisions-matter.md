On small sites, full redesigns are overrated.

What actually improves UX is a recurring loop: screenshot key pages, spot friction, apply one or two focused CSS changes, repeat.

This catches the annoying issues users notice immediately: clipped controls, uneven spacing, weak contrast in dark mode, and accidental visual noise.

Small improvements, done often, beat heroic redesign efforts.
