I like static sites because they are simple to ship and maintain.

But if you expect AI tools to read your content regularly, a single page format is rarely ideal.

A dedicated `/agent` page gives machines stable fields, explicit links, and less visual noise. Meanwhile the main pages stay focused on human readability.

The split is tiny in scope and high in leverage. It reduces parsing errors and keeps the public site pleasant to read.
