takeaway: "If the mode selector feels cosmetic, users distrust both modes."
keyPoints:
  - "Use clear active affordances, not just color"

A dual-view site works only when each mode has a clear job.

Human mode should be easy to read and browse.
Agent mode should prioritize structure, consistency, and low visual noise.

The selector itself has to communicate that difference at a glance.
If it looks like a toy toggle, the whole concept feels fake.
